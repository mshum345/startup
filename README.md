# Startup
Keeping track of your Minecraft resources can be tiresome and confusing. Resources stored in your chests in game can only be viewed one chest at a time and it is difficult to know exactly what resources you have available to you when planning out something to build. With this new application you will be able to track every resource you have and view them all in one application. This will greatly decrease confusing and unnecessary planning time when playing Minecraft.

- Default language can be applied at the beginning of an HTML document
- SVG can be used to make fairly complex designs
