# startup
In this assignment I learned a lot about github and esspecially merge conflicts. I have used github before with vscode but I have never ran into any merge conflicts so it is nice to know that I will be able to handle them in the future. I also learned more about how to use a personal access token as this is how I am accessing my github account from my development environment.
