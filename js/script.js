Yet amidst these difficult times, Barfire's magnificence still shines, with its sandstone buildings and thousands of magical prahs trees adorning the landscape.

While the dragon cult watches closely, many citizens of Barfire still practice their arcane arts in secret, their magical abilities stemming from the consumption of prahs fruit.

It was a beacon of light and hope, a place where people from all walks of life could come together to share their talents and dreams. But all of that changed when the Dragon Lord and his minions descended upon Skyhaven. The sky turned black with smoke and ash, and the ground shook with the thunderous roar of dragonfire. The people of Skyhaven fought valiantly to defend their city, but in the end, they were no match for the might of the dragons. The once-proud towers crumbled, the sparkling fountains ran dry, and the gardens withered and died. All that remained was a wasteland of ash and ruins, a stark reminder of the city's tragic fate. The few survivors of the Dragon Lord's assault were forced into the diamond mines that lay beneath the nearby Charr Lake.

It is said that the portals were sealed and now the northern tribes patrol these mountains to prevent any mortal who would seek to reopen those ancient gateways. Over time, the portals have been lost and forgotten, their locations shrouded in mystery.
